# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a tool that allows you to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in your code. One of the more common version-control programs is called Git.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Creating a branch in Git gives you a "copy" of your project to work on. Branches are useful when working on different feature simultaneously for a product with other individuals.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

When you commit a set of files and folders, you are making a save point for the project. The commit message describes this save point for future reference. A good commit message is detailed and states what was changed since the last commit. 
Before you can commit, all of your files must be added to the staging list. Before you can check out a new branch or move to an existing branch, all files must be committed. Once files are committed, you have a save point and you can go back to this point later if needed.

* What is a merge conflict?

 Merge conflict happens when two branches have changed the same part of the same file, and then those branches are merged together. For example, if you make a change on a particular line in a file, and your colleague working in a repository makes a change on the exact same line, a merge conflict occurs. Git has trouble understanding which change should be used, so it asks you to help out.
