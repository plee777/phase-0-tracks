not sure.

6. What is a method? Why might a programmer choose to use a method?
method is also known as a function. programmers choose to use a method to describe a set of compiled programs that can be called up easily

7. Define the following terms as they relate to a method. 

return value - the output
side effect - the “side effect” while getting the return value
parameter - the variables you can control
argument - the input of the method
implicit return - returns that are implied.

8. What are global scope and method scope? How do those scopes impact the availability of data at different points in a program?
